# Scissors Game üéÆ‚úÇÔ∏è

A fun and addictive hair-cutting game inspired by Fruit Ninja! Instead of slicing fruits, you're cutting falling hair with perfectly timed scissors movements.

## Game Description

The Scissors Game is a reaction-based arcade game where players control a pair of scissors to cut falling hair. The scissors continuously move up and down on the left side of the screen, and when you tap (or click), the scissors move horizontally across the screen to cut through any hair in their path.

### How to Play:
- üéØ **Objective**: Cut as much falling hair as possible
- ‚úÇÔ∏è **Controls**: Tap/Click anywhere on the screen to make the scissors move right
- üìç **Timing**: The scissors move up and down automatically - time your taps perfectly!
- üé≤ **Strategy**: Watch the falling hair patterns and time your cuts for maximum points

### Game Features:
- Smooth scissors movement animation
- Randomly falling hair from the top of the screen
- Score tracking system
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Satisfying cutting animations

This project was built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for fast development and optimized builds.
