# Scissors Game üéÆ‚úÇÔ∏è

A fun and addictive hair-cutting game inspired by Fruit Ninja! Instead of slicing fruits, you're cutting falling hair with perfectly timed scissors movements.

## Game Description

The Scissors Game is a reaction-based arcade game where players control a pair of scissors to cut falling hair. The scissors continuously move up and down on the left side of the screen, and when you tap (or click), the scissors move horizontally across the screen to cut through any hair in their path.

### How to Play:
- üéØ **Objective**: Cut as much falling hair as possible
- ‚úÇÔ∏è **Controls**: Tap/Click anywhere on the screen to make the scissors move right
- üìç **Timing**: The scissors move up and down automatically - time your taps perfectly!
- üé≤ **Strategy**: Watch the falling hair patterns and time your cuts for maximum points

### Game Features:
- Smooth scissors movement animation
- Randomly falling hair from the top of the screen
- Score tracking system
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Satisfying cutting animations

This project was built with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Installation

To install and run the Scissors Game locally on your machine:

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- npm (comes with Node.js)

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/umangaamatya/scissors-game
   cd scissors-game
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. **Open your browser**
   - Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
   - The game should now be running!

### Building for Production

To create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

This creates a `build` folder with optimized files ready for deployment.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
